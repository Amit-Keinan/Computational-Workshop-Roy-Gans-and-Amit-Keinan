This repository contains code developed as part of a computational neuroscience lab workshop, focusing on fMRI data analysis and group-level comparisons.
In the folder same vs different group analysis, the code implements an analysis of fMRI data, computing the correlation between an individual studentâ€™s neural activity and the mean neural activity of their in-group (same degree program) compared to their out-group (different degree program).
