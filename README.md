This repository contains code developed as part of a computational neuroscience lab workshop, focusing on fMRI data analysis and group-level comparisons.

classification of social distance folder: This folder contains code that runs SVM (Support Vector Machine) model to classify social distance between pairs of participants. The model uses correlations in their neural activity (ISC, inter-subject correlation) as input features, is trained with social distance labels, and outputs predictions of social distance across different time points, including visualizations such as confusion matrices. Both linear SVM and non-linear kernels (RBF, polynomial) were applied in the analyses.

same vs different group analysis folder: This folder contains code that implements an analysis of fMRI data, computing the correlation between an individual studentâ€™s neural activity and the mean neural activity of their in-group (same degree program) compared to their out-group (different degree program). A MATLAB file is included to visualize the results as a CIFTI file.
